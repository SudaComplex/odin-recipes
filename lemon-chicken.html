        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>pound the chicken breasts out until you’ve 
                got fairly thin chicken cutlets. For a shortcut 
                here you could buy thin cut chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                season both sides of the chicken with salt 
                and pepper and dredge each side in flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the pan and melt olive oil and butter in pan. 
                Add the chicken breasts and sear on both sides until 
                golden brown and cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the chicken to a plate then saute the garlic. 
                Pour in chicken broth then scrape up browned bits 
                from the bottom (it gives it the best flavor!). 
                Stir in lemon juice and bring mixture to a simmer, 
                reduce heat slightly and let simmer until it’s 
                reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the butter and lemon zest and melt butter through. 
                Then return chicken to pan, spoon pan sauce over 
                chicken breasts and sprinkle with parsley. 
                Serve chicken warm. See, easy breezy, right?
