            <li>Lean ground beef (7% to 15% fat content)</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <h4>Meatballs:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine diced crustless bread pieces with 
                2/3 cup water and set aside for 5 minutes 
                then mash together with a fork.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl (I use my KitchenAid 
                mixer to do the work), add: 1 lb ground beef, 
                1 lb sausage, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 4 minced 
                garlic cloves, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 
                1 egg and the mashed moist bread crumbs. 
                Mix until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Form into 1 1/2″ meatballs 
                (about a flat ice cream scoop’s worth of meat). 
                Dredge/roll meatballs in flour. Heat a deep, 
                large, heavy skillet or a Dutch oven over medium 
                heat with about 3 Tbsp oil. Add meatballs in 
                batches so you don’t crowd the pan and saute 
                until browned on all sides (6 min total or 2 min per side). 
                Remove meatballs to a separate dish and set aside 
                (don’t worry about cooking through at this point).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Marinara Sauce:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In the same skillet over medium heat, add more oil if 
                needed and saute 1 cup chopped onion stirring often until 
                soft and golden (5 min). Add 4 cloves minced garlic and 
                stir 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and 2 bay leaves. 
                Bring to a light boil 
                (stir to make sure it’s actually boiling and hot and 
                not just letting bubbles to the surface).
            </li>
            <li>Add meatballs back into the pan with tomato sauce, 
                partially cover and cook at a gentle simmer for 30 min, 
                turning the meatballs occasionally. Meatballs will be 
                tender and sauce will be thickened. 5 minutes before 
                your sauce is done, stir in chopped fresh basil and 
                add salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Finishing Details:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook pasta according to package instructions until 
                aldente or softer if your family loves it that way! 
                Truth be told, I love slightly overcooked pasta. 
                Drain pasta and return to the empty pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour sauce and meatballs over spaghetti and toss gently to combine. 
                To serve family-style, transfer to a large platter, 
                garnish with more parmesan cheese and fresh basil 
                leaves if desired and serve hot.
            </li>
        </ol>
